@dannellamunoz I found this out when I ordered wings last night. The cashier said due to the chicken shortage our prices went up. So instead of paying $7.99 for a order of wings, now it's $14.99. WTF.....

Should we send chicken legs @chamath ... $GME @wallstreetbets
@McDonaldsUK Fun fact: The bacon comes precooked in one of those blue bags you see lettuce in when subway runs out, it’s just ripped open and poured in a plastic container, not even heated up before throwing it on your burger/chicken. Only the breakfast roll bacon is cooked onsite. 😘
Is it weird that I don’t like fried chicken. The only one I will eat is the 3 piece spicy chicken combo from Louisana fried chicken , golden bird
Tried @McDonalds new #crispychicken today and it was awful! Looked like someone just tossed everything in the box with a tiny piece of chicken. The bun was burnt, the chicken was warm at best, and the flavor was non-existent. Places like @ChickfilA have nothing to worry about.

@jmonkeybars For arguments sake, if the argument is that killing animals causes suffering, then that's the argument. Not how graphic the suffering might be. So if plants suffer, it wouldn't have to matter that it's not the same as a chicken running w/o it's head. 

I dunno.

@ChrisDeebo @KG_KingKuro @NegativeArrow_ Unfortunately, I can't see WB ever making a real Icon movie. If they ever did, they'd totally cut slavery out of his origin. They're far too chicken shit to actually cover that kind of thing in a big super hero movie.

It was after she’d herded the four chickens into the coop, and checked again that there were four of them, that Susanna turned to look into the darkness. Because there were supposed to be five chickens.

She could hear the fifth chicken.
 @buffetbeercan: RT if you like naked boys who brush their teeth and eat Popeyes chicken sammies 😈 https://t.co/dHEgSO5x7M
Well, she could hear a chicken making an odd trilling sound. Not angry enough to squawk or hiss, but definitely a more annoyed sound than the soft chatter of the others.

Only the trill seemed to be coming from the same place as the chatter.

Susanna turned back toward the coop.

There were two. She’d heard two voices, and she saw two shapes before one unfurled its wings, blocking Susanna’s view of the other.

The dragon that had spread its wings leaned toward her. Its four eyes narrowed. It growled.

The chicken in its jaws kind of ruined the effect.

“You let go of my hen,” Susanna warned. “And we needn’t have any trouble.”

The hidden dragon made a frightening, whimpering sound. The one glaring at Susanna spat the chicken out of its mouth and growled at her again.

Susanna chose to ignore this.

“Thank you,” she said.

She saw the dragon’s wings shift, lowering slightly, and it tilted its head. There was a long moment of silence.

“You can give us something,” the dragon said finally, dropping its wings completely.

“Chicken? Or would you prefer some other kind of meat?”

"Chicken."

"Alright."

Had I then been able to associate killing a lizard and the killing of cows/chicken/fish, I'd have probably gone #vegan sooner. But our society programmed us to think differently; to view certain animals as commodities rather than living beings like us, dogs, and cats.
Food takes I will die by:
*Uncooked ramen is a good quick snack.
*Smashed burgers are the best form of burger. 
*Oh, and Shake Shack is overrated.
*A Chinese food order is worthless without Crab Rangoon.
*Unsweetened tea &gt; Sweet tea.
*Lemon cake is so good, it should be illegal.

@EWoodhouse7 @shvetaraju @mamasaurusMeg Sure. There are instances where even natural immunity wanes over time- like varicella and chicken pox. Also some viruses don’t mount a large antibody response in the first place. Not all antibody responses cross different strains allowing re-infection.

Very simple

Go out and buy a cheap slow-cooker

Sunday night, throw 5 chicken breasts in it &amp; set it for ‘low heat, 8hrs long’

After 4 hours, add Buffalo sauce (can add BBQ, but I avoid the sugary condiments, when dieting)

After the 8 hours, you will have pounds of beautiful..
shredded Buffalo chicken

You don’t need butter or salt or anything else

Just chicken and Baby Ray’s Buffalo Sauce (that’s my go to)

Toss it in tubberwear, throw it in fridge for whenever you need a snack

I like to have hummus on hand, and I’ll use a celery stick to scoop..
Just pounded out some chicken tacos and quesadillas for #CincodeMayo. Now I'm ready for some big action streaming. Let's go!
up the shredded chicken and dip it in my hummus

Sounds like a poor man’s snack, maybe

But it’s absolutely delicious and the chicken remains fantastic for quite some time

This is ‘The Way’ when it comes to manifesting your most epic body

Prepare DELICIOUS food, in advance.

Now the reason there’s a chicken shortage is bc there’s a new chicken sandwich every week, do we need that? Lol.

Q: Can I warm up GF and non-GF chicken fingers at the same time in the oven?
A: Convection ovens are high risk as the air circulates around, cover the GF items in this case. In a regular item, as long as the GF product is on top, you're fine!!

@TheJackBly @creation247 Disagree. Meat is perhaps the most expensive thing in the grocery store. Its so much cheaper to buy fast food than chicken breast.

However its 100% worth it to invest in.

Note to self and everyone: don’t cook and eat pork when you haven’t ate it for years, you’ll only end up with food poisoning and that’s no fun with the doubled over pain for the last 24 hours followed by every other symptom. Stick to chicken and fish only.

@tinfoilpuff You may be able to have quail as the hens are quiet. Roos can be a little low when they crow but not like a chicken and no louder than a pissed off parrot. Plus they have to stay caged and you can eat the eggs and, if you want, incubate and raise your own meat.

@JJ_Burry At dawn, the greenwood witch
sweeps puffs of cold hearth ash
out into the sunbeams,
hexes up a new blue flame under
her old black kettlepot.

Her moss-thatched hut rumbles,
arcane chicken feet
pulling up from the loam,
lopes off in search of bog lore.

@SylviaRolle @michaelharriot ch in Italian is K (like Chianti) - there is no letter 'K' - in Italian the 'ch' sound is cc (like Chicken Cacciatore) - a lot of those old english words were latin first, so maybe they wrote it with a ch and later added the German K but forgot to change school, scholar, etc
@BeowulfDavey @Texas_talon @nrawomen @NRA @Shinedown1911 @SurvivorKitty You didn't call "any woman" a sociopath, you called women who join the NRA sociopaths. 

I'm a grandmother, don't own a gun. I'm a Texan, never even shot a gun. (Broke a BB gun shooting at a chicken.) I'm a life member of the NRA, not a sociopath.
