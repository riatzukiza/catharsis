me explaining how writing 4 tweets to explain a minecraft‚Äôs character‚Äôs danganronpa kinlist is normal https://t.co/uZAXWtCgVT
and now if we take those 2 number 15,863,040,000 + 21,150,720,000 = 37,013,760,000. steve is strong enough to hold 37 BILLION pounds. but no. i think we can push this farther. MUCH farther. donkeys can hold chests in minecraft and we can fill those chests with shulkers 4/25
steve can run and jump while carrying all of this. he can climb the ladder holding the 750 trillion pounds worth of donkeys on leads then run and jump in the air carrying everything. so our next step is to find out how fast steve is. so each minecraft block is 1 meter 9/25
is almost 4 trillion pounds. so lets summarize. if im fighting steve from minecraft thats saying its me against someone who has impenetrable armor and the strongest weapons forged from minerals of other dimensions, is fast as usain bolt, strong enough to hold 4 trillion  24/25

Writing for Minecraft is on the wall. It's intentionally made for new 3DS only and it's needed because of it's extra RAM. I could manually install new RAM (which I don't feel like doing because I don't trust myself) or patch it but there are many alternatives.

call out post or something for pissing the bed but apparently anti's wrote it but it ended up just being an entire twitter thread of people confused why it was trending as i was very confused because i saw it at 2 in the morning. This is no Minecraft Manhunt videos that Dream and
Georgenotfound do on Dream's Minecraft Manhunt Channel this is the advertisement video i made so that i could be sexy and become a mcyt streamer also because Georgenotfound is kinda cool im not gonna lie but i am an awkward 22 year old who is just trying to make a living off
@cursedtommy @ibxtoycat Yes

Ore veins are something they briefly talked about at Minecraft Live, but they're basically very large ore formations that randomly generate underground
Currently there are 2: iron ore veins and copper ore veins
video games like everyone else is.I should really watch Minecraft but in a Shopping Cart which is Quackitys video but right after this uploads I'm probably going to be live on twitch because streaming daily is all I have. I think I could probably be the 6th hunter if i pop off in
the Minecraft Manhunt series and Dream would never win. Honestly I could be the only hunter and win Minecraft Manhunt, i could be the speedrunner and still win because I am just that sexy. Maybe dream should watch my videos instead. I don't know I am so tired.

Everyday, I remember people who stan MCYT have no cognitive thought and think everything problematic besides minecraft. Wait until they hear about dream praising notch.
"Gamification" is when you infuse your tech with experience points, achievements, and leaderboards‚Äîaka, superficial, manipulative features that have nothing to do with gameplay.

Future tech shouldn't be "gamified." It should be game-like.

 @lithub: Looks like we're finally going to have to learn what Minecraft is. https://t.co/gYdHED5kMH
I never understood the minecraft speedrunning
for me it goes against the spirit of the game to play it with the intention of beating it at all (let alone competing for beating it in the most efficient way)

for me minecraft was always about self expression and relaxation
apparently you're not supposed to use stone pickaxes to dig massive holes in minecraft

Just wanna do a quick thank you to everyone who joined my OMORI streams. Apologies for the low energy these days (LOTS of Minecraft + prepping portfolio/commissions + scheduling), so I'll take the next moment to properly rest up.

@tvegior This is a youtuber/twitch streamer called Tommyinnit he mainly plays minecraft! He also participates in that minecraft rp I‚Äôm always screaming about lmao
@SoupAPlayer It's not comparable to Minecraft even. Minecraft completely disengaged from the pretense of having a central narrative in the core game. It let it up to the players to decide and it took a life of it's own.

Here you have a story used for context that is constantly undermined.
An update: I am PlaZma, not Pl1Zma anymore coz when I was on VRchat, every single server was calling me Ph1LzA Minecraft. They do this in discord and youtube.
